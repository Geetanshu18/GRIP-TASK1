# GRIP-TASK1
# Student Score Prediction Model
 This is a supervised machine learning exercise using simple linear regression model . it aims to predict the score of a student based on the number of hours they have studied.
 Firstly, start with Data Collection, Load and read the dataset.
 Next , we Explore the data
 Next , porcess and clean the data
 Now, Start Data Visualization step by Plotting our data to determine if it is eligible for linear regression model
 By analyzing the plot, it gets clear that the data can be used in a linear regression model as there is a clear linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables! now we prepare our dataset to fit into the model as we split our data to train and test datasets
 Make a prediction using the Regressor and second checking of the prediction
 At last we Calculate Accuracy and Error
